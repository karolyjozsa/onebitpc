# Simulation of the 1-bit computer

This program simultaes the 1-bit computer presented by [the Tomâ€™s Hardware article](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/1-bit-cpu-for-super-low-performance-computer-launched-sells-out-promptly).

The aim is to simulate the [schematics](https://doc.switch-science.com/media/files/a3866019-a5e2-46d1-ac4c-4bec913f2f47.jpg) as accurate as possible.

The computer elements are separated into "boardsections", which are the logical building blocks of a comuter (ROM, Clock, CPU). They use the physical building blocks, implemented in the "hardware".
